## Introduction

### Sampling Ratio
Sampling Ratio is Defined as the Number of Samples that any Object can have. [by Default the Epochs for KSOFM for Large Data (i.e. UIN >= 10k) = 2500, thus samplingRatio = 2500, but it has to be Noted that for Small Data (i.e. UIN < 10k), Epoch for KSOFM has to be >= 7500]
